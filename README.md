### `About:`
A React app that is used as a boilerplate for starting new projects that require user account functionality.  Redux is being used for state management and Bootstrap is being used for UI styling.   
This app was built to use this [Django API](https://github.com/Adamhunter108/django-api-login) but can be customized for a different backend.
