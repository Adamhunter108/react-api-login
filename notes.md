[React toolchain overviews](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

Create React App requires Node 14 or higher.  To update node, use nvm (node version manager)
```bash
$ # check node version
$ node -v
$ # install latest version of node
$ nvm install node
$ # create react app
$ npx create-react-app <app-name>
$ # make sure it worked
$ # change into newly created app directory
$ cd <app-name>
$ # start development server
$ npm start
```
if that was successful, the react app will be available to view in a browser at: 
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
or on any device on the network:
```bash
http://192.168.1.109:3000
```
